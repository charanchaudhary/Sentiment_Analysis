**Sentiment Analysis with Amazon Reviews Dataset.** <br>
I'm keeping my documents/source codes related to this project.<br>

**Project summary:**<br>


**Our task in this project is the following:**<br>

Download the dataset of Amazon reviews.<br>
Create our own dataset from the Amazon reviews.<br>
Decide whether people like or dislike the product they bought. Label each review with a sentiment score.<br>

**Techniques Employed**<br>
In order to get a deeper understanding of peopleâ€™s opinion about different types of products, you will employ various NLP techniques. Here is a short list about what we will do and what techniques we will use.<br>



Project Outline<br>
The project is made up of five steps, which are built on each other:<br>
<br>
Creating your dataset.<br>
Creating a dictionary-based sentiment analyzer.<br>
Evaluating your dictionary-based sentiment analyzer.<br>
Creating neural network-based sentiment analyzers.<br>
Reporting your results.<br>

Both the steps and the techniques in this project model a real-life scenario.<br>

**Dataset**<br>
The Amazon review dataset can be downloaded from here. Download the zipped json file of the category of video games 5 core, which can be found under the title Small subsets for experimentation. Once the download is complete, extract the file.
