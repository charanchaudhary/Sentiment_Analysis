Sentiment Analysis with Amazon Reviews Dataset.
I'm keeping my documents/source codes related to this project.

Project summary:


Our task in this project is the following:

Download the dataset of Amazon reviews.
Create our own dataset from the Amazon reviews.
Decide whether people like or dislike the product they bought. Label each review with a sentiment score.

Techniques Employed
In order to get a deeper understanding of peopleâ€™s opinion about different types of products, you will employ various NLP techniques. Here is a short list about what we will do and what techniques we will use.



Project Outline
The project is made up of five steps, which are built on each other:

Creating your dataset.
Creating a dictionary-based sentiment analyzer.
Evaluating your dictionary-based sentiment analyzer.
Creating neural network-based sentiment analyzers.
Reporting your results.

Both the steps and the techniques in this project model a real-life scenario.

Dataset
The Amazon review dataset can be downloaded from here. Download the zipped json file of the category of video games 5 core, which can be found under the title Small subsets for experimentation. Once the download is complete, extract the file.
